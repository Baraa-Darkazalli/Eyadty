### Clinic Management System Project<br>
<br>
EYADTY project,it is a medical clinics management system, the project contains an integrated system with roles for each of the doctors, patients, receptions and, of course, the admin.<br>
The project mainly revolves around online appointments booking and electronic follow-up of appointmetns. It also contains a smart system to automatically displace appointments, as it automatically background checks the current appointments, and in the event that a patient is late, it cancels his appointment with a message of apology to the patient through notifications and sends a message to the affected patients with their appointments at the time of the new appointment.
The system allows receptions to book a patient in an emergency situation and it will be automatically arranged in the waiting table with a higher priority than the appointment patients.<br>
The doctor can monitor his waiting schedule and the patient who will enter shortly, in addition to creating sessions and filling in their data such as analyzes, medicines and others.<br>
The system also provides the clinic with an inspection service by checking a QR code for each employee to register attendance as soon as he comes to the clinic.<br>
The system provides a medical blog service that can be published by doctors and for interaction by patients.<br>
And do not forget to display the important statistics for the admin to be able to monitor the direction of the center's progress.
